					<h1>Hello Automattic!</h1>
						<p>I'm very happy to finally be getting in touch to express my interest in joining your company!<br>
						I've been planning to do so for some time now but really wanted to learn more about Automattic before doing so.<br>
						Now I'm fully convinced that Automattic could be a great company to work for!<br>
						Below, I'll explain why I would love to work at Automattic, why now and why I think I could give my contribution to the company.<br>
						Sorry if something could be a repetition of the answers given in the form on the Work with us page.<br>
						Special thanks to Matt Mullenweg and Spen Taylor who inspired me to create this small webpage for my application.<br>
						Thanks for taking the time to read this far - I hope you enjoy the rest!<br>
						Antonella</p>

					<h1>Why Automattic?</h1>
						<p>The first time I came across the Automattic website two years ago and read about the company, people, values and products, I thought I was dreaming.<br>
						Every single line of the company's creed was exactly what I was looking for.<br>
						"Does a similar company really exist on Earth?" I reflected.<br>
						I began to do some research, watch YouTube videos of Happiness Engineers and other Automatticians, read a lot of contents on Matt Mullenweg's Distributed blog and all this left a great impression on me.<br>
						Automattic has been one of the reasons that led me to enroll in a Front end and WordPress development course with Skillcrush: I was willing to achieve the necessary qualifications to be able to apply.</p>

					<h1>Why now?</h1>
						<p>It's been a year now since I began the Front end and WordPress development courses with Skillcrush.<br>
						Am I job ready? I would really like to know this and I think the only way could be getting a job and trying to apply what I've learned!<br>
						I've recently read a quote by Benjamin Franklin that I believe could be applicable to this case:<br></p>
						<p>"Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn."</p>
						<p>My curiosity and desire to learn are big and I can't wait to acquire new skills from other Automatticians.</p>

					<h1>Why me?</h1>
						<p>I've enjoyed tinkering with computers and videogames since I was a kid.<br> 
						After 20+ years in the translation industry, I decided to brush up my technology skills and started learning to code with Skillcrush, an online coding school.<br>
						My love for development started with a great passion for blogs: I love reading posts on various contents (meditation, personal growth, running, sea and lighthouses, dogs, etc.) and this made me very curious about creating these websites.<br>
						It's been very hard to learn coding alone, starting from scratch, but it was worth it.<br>
						It increased my problem-solving ability (I'm a mother of two girls....problem-solving is my daily bread and butter!).<br>
						I've worked very hard this year to meet my goals and I'm proud of my achievements.<br>
						I've started contributing to WordPress with the Italian Polyglots team and I've had the opportunity to see what is like to work on such a wonderful open source project.<br>
						I hope I can contribute further!</p>
